The project is a website that is a combination of the task flow and sentimental analysis project model. It lets employers match with freelancers that align with their requirements while also providing freelancers with an oppurtunity for jobs with transparent and secure exchanges. 

## Features

1. Sentiment Analysis model to provide detailed feedback to the freelancers from their employers.
2. Easy user interface for convenient platform navigation.
3. Efficient machine learning models to connect employers with suitable freelancers. 

## Why use this?

This platform would provide an amazing opportunity to hire freelancers for work that is catered to you and on the flip case, you are a freelancer, it matches you to employers that would use your skills properly.

## Why we built this?

We built this to fix the gap between organisations and freelancers when it comes to hiring. It provides a user friendly interface that improves the oppurtunities freelancers receive as well as catering to the employer's requests and expectations.
